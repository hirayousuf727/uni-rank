<ul>
    
    <li> being chartered, licensed or accredited by the appropriate Pakistani higher education-related organization</li>
                <li>  offering at least three-year bachelor's degrees or postgraduate master's or doctoral degrees</li>

                                                <h2>Overview</h2>I bow my head to the Allah the Almighty for His blessings in accomplishing my first year at Dawood University and keeping me strong and steady under all circumstances. Reflecting on the past year fills me with a little sense of achievement at the progress and achievements, we have accomplished, as a team.
                                                It is my privilege to present the second newsletter of Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, showcasing significant milestones and transformative initiatives and academic, financial and administrative reforms.
                                                We have made a historic leap forward by establishing the Faculty of Information & Computing Sciences at a new site in Gulberg Town. This expansion was marked by a simple yet elegant ceremony of the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Gulberg Town. After which Major Tufail Shaheed School was handed over to Dawood University. This new site will host programs in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, and Data Sciences, further strengthening our commitment to providing cutting-edge education.
                                                In a bid to enhance employment opportunities for our students in both local and international markets, Dawood University has started a Free Micro-Degree Program. Final year students will now have the opportunity to receive international courses and certificates, with all expenses covered by the university. This initiative underscores our dedication to equipping our students with the skills and qualifications needed and recognized in the global arena.
                                                I am excited to share that we successfully organised the first-ever “Students’ Week,” an event that electrified and revitalized our university as a community. This week-long celebration included a variety of activities showcasing the inner talent of every student during comedy shows, open mic sessions, stage dramas, musical performances, poetry readings, cultural dances, art exhibitions, sports competitions, and computer games. A special highlight was the Naat Khwani competition, which brought a sufi atmosphere to the university.
                                            <br>
                                            Our 11th Convocation marked a new era for Dawood University, held for the first time at the prestigious Governor's House Sindh. This historic venue provided a befitting backdrop for celebrating the excellence and hard work of our graduates as they embark on their professional journeys.
                                            I am pleased to report that all statutory bodies have been diligently meeting their schedules. The 7th and 6th Senate meetings successfully approved all budget proposals well in time. 03 Syndicate meetings, The Finance and Planning Committee meetings after every quarter acknowledged our efforts to reduce the financial deficit yet keeping the development projects progressing at decent pace. The appreciation and support from these bodies reflect our collective commitment to the university's financial stability, good governance and quality education & research for better future of aspiring graduates.
                                            As we move forward, I am confident that our collective efforts and dedication will continue to drive Dawood University toward new heights of success with strong and deep rooted foundation built upon ethics, principles, discipline, dignity, healthy competition and compassionate community as Dawoodian. Together, we can !

          <h2>Overview</h2>
            It was in 1955 the Institute of Public and Business Administration (IPBA) was established, making it one of the oldest business school outside North America. Initial technical support was provided by the world famous Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania. Soon after the University of Southern California set up various facilities at the Institute and several prominent American professors were assigned to the IBA. The course contents, the curriculum, the pedagogical tools and the assessment and testing methods were developed under the guidance of reputed scholars from these two institutions. IBA has zealously guarded the high standards and academic traditions it had inherited from Wharton and USC while adapting and adjusting them with the passage of time.In 1956 a two-year MBA morning program commenced as a constituent unit of the University of Karachi. Faculty was hired in the department of Public and Business Administration, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania and assisted by United States International Corporation Administration, now USAID. In 1957, a two-year MBA evening program was launched to cater to the needs of numerous working executives and managers who were interested in furthering their careers through part-time business studies

    <h1 class="h1">University of Karachi</h1>
  <img src="uni of karachi logo.png" alt="" class="kar">
  Spread over 1200 acres of land, University of Karachi was established through the parliament as a Federal University in 1951. However, through another act of the parliament in 1962 its status was redefined as university of the province of Sindh. On 23rd October, 1950 the Karachi University Act was passed and after an amendment in 1951, it was enacted and Prof A. B. A Haleem was appointed as its first Vice Chancellor. For the first two years, the University of Karachi remained as an examination University for the affiliated colleges. In the year 1953, it started its teaching and research activities at two Faculties of Arts and Science. Opened with an initial intake of 50 students, the university is now a sprawling structure of 53 Departments and 20 world class and highly reputable Research Centers and Institutes, under eight faculties of Arts, Science, Islamic Studies, Pharmacy, Management and Administrative Sciences, Law, Education and Medicine. At present, the enrolment of regular students at the Campus is slightly over 41,000 (Approximately) as on 30/06/2018. There are over 700 teachers and more than 2100 supporting staff.

  The University in the beginning was housed in small buildings adjacent to the Civil Hospital. Meanwhile, due to rapid expansion, it began to be felt that the space in which the university was functioning was not enough for its needs. Moreover, the atmosphere of the congested and polluted area was not conducive to higher education and research. Thus, a plot of 1279 acres of land was acquired on the Country Club Road (now University Road) and on 18th January 1960 the university was shifted to the new campus. Thus began, a new phase in the life of the university. The day is still commemorated by various old students' Association and the University administration jointly.
